## Bro Dashboard

To set up the dashboard, use `pip` to install:
- flask
- flask_socketio
- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas
- scp
- paramiko

(I might be forgetting something, but the console will yell at you.)

To run, first create a configuration file called `config.json` that looks something like this:

```
{
	"username": "your-username",
	"password": "your-password,
	"server": "remote.server.url.edu"
}
```
